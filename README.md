# Fountain

This is the Fountain application used by [Ofwat](http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/) for the storage, modelling and analysis of regulatory data. 

This is a stripped down version of the application with many of the core tests missing as they contain information that may be considered commercially sensitive. Through testing is ran on an internal build server for the production release. 

This is a work in progress release that we are migrating to be in the public domain. 

To build the project use [Gradle](http://gradle.org)
